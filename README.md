# CIVE202_Project2
Calculation algorithm for determining components, by weight, for a concrete mix of specified characteristics. This algorithm is produced for use by the Nebraska Department of Transportation to replace a legacy Microsoft Excel-based tool.

## How to use this program
- Open the [project code document](CIVE202_Spring2026_Group6_Project2_PythonCode.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebooks
- Run each segment of code
- After running last segment, you will be prompted to enter information about your desired mix.
  - Enter cementitious material weights
  - Enter desired air and water contents
  - Enter aggregate percentages
  - Enter specific gravities of materials
- The required amounts of each material (by weight) should print below.
- Several common mix designs are already calculated below the main code. See these for pre-calculated weights for these designs.
